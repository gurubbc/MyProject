<h1> Welcome page </h1>
<p>
A table of contents often abbreviated as TOC is what outlines the titles 
and/or gives a brief description of the first-level headers, 
second level headers or even third level headers in more detailed books. 
It can also be referred to as Contents and the depth of the details will be 
determined by the length of the given book.</p>
<p> 
Longer books will tend to have less details. 
The TOC is not only found in books, formal reports which are longer than 
10 pages also have a table of contents. 
It usually comes after the title page, the copyright notices as well as the 
abstract if itâ€™s available especially in technical journals. 
It also appears before any list of tables or figures, 
the foreword and the preface.
